The real Chris Kempson's [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16)
for [concfg](https://github.com/lukesampson/concfg).

concfg is an utility to import and export Windows console settings bundled with
[Scoop](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop), a command-line installer
for Windows created by Luke Sampson.

**NOTE:** All presets in this repository are generated by a base16-builder,
I use [base16-builder-typescript].

About the Color Mapping
-----------------------

Windows Console (ConHost.exe) only use 16 colors palette,
therefore [base16](http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/),
which is based on 16 colors, would be the best themes solution for ConHost.

But there are color mapping difference between Windows Console and other terminals or applications.
The order of `ColorTable` of Windows Console doesn't map the [ANSI escape color], explained [here].
We need to remapping it manually. Here is the mapping table.

| ANSI/VT name   | ANSI/VT FG Code* | ANSI/VT BG Code | cmd.exe      | PowerShell  | ColorTable |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| Black          | \`e[30m          | \`e[40m         | Black        | Black       | 00         |
| Red            | \`e[31m          | \`e[41m         | Red          | DarkRed     | 04         |
| Green          | \`e[32m          | \`e[42m         | Green        | DarkGreen   | 02         |
| Yellow         | \`e[33m          | \`e[43m         | Yellow       | DarkYellow  | 06         |
| Blue           | \`e[34m          | \`e[44m         | Blue         | DarkBlue    | 01         |
| Magenta        | \`e[35m          | \`e[45m         | Purple       | DarkMagenta | 05         |
| Cyan           | \`e[36m          | \`e[46m         | Aqua         | DarkCyan    | 03         |
| White          | \`e[37m          | \`e[47m         | White        | Gray        | 07         |
| Bright Black   | \`e[90m          | \`e[100m        | Gray         | DarkGray    | 08         |
| Bright Red     | \`e[91m          | \`e[101m        | Light Red    | Red         | 12         |
| Bright Green   | \`e[92m          | \`e[102m        | Light Green  | Green       | 10         |
| Bright Yellow  | \`e[93m          | \`e[103m        | Light Yellow | Yellow      | 14         |
| Bright Blue    | \`e[94m          | \`e[104m        | Light Blue   | Blue        | 09         |
| Bright Magenta | \`e[95m          | \`e[105m        | Light Purple | Magenta     | 13         |
| Bright Cyan    | \`e[96m          | \`e[106m        | Light Aqua   | Cyan        | 11         |
| Bright White   | \`e[97m          | \`e[107m        | Brigh tWhite | White       | 15         |

*Notice if you want to use ANSI Escape Sequences in Windows Console, you should know that
only Windows 10 v1511 (TH2, build 10586) or later support ANSI Escape Sequences.
See [details](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16755142/how-to-make-win32-console-recognize-ansi-vt100-escape-sequences).

So if you want to change the `Red` color of Windows Console (or `DarkRed` of PowerShell),
you should modify `ColorTable[04]` instead of `ColorTable[01]`. his is very important,
wrong color mapping could make your theme ooks bad. To determine that if a theme's
color mapping is correct, run `git diff` in a dirty it directory, and see
the diff result. Normally the diff colors should be `Red` and `Green`.

### About command line token colors

Since PowerShell 5, the new [PSReadline] brings command line tokens colors feature,
the token (e.g. String, Parameter) of command line has its own color, execute
`Get-PSReadlineOption` in PowerShell then you will see some attributes like
`KeywordForegroundColor`, `ParameterForegroundColor`, and they have default values.

Base16 redefined the 16 colors palette, after using a base16 theme, `Red2Red` or
`BrightMagenta2BrightMagenta` become false. `ColorTable[12]`(`Red` of PowerShell)
can be a `orange (#ff9f43)` color in `base16-snazzy` or a `pink` color in another base16 theme,
or even grayscale (*In Base16, colors base00 to base07 are typically variations of a shade and run from darkest to lightest.*). The 16 colors of Windows Console are **HEAVILY CHANGED** after importing base16 themes,
and affects the command line tokens colors. Base16 themes break the color mapping,
and cause bad readability to commands, there is a discussion [here](https://github.com/lukesampson/concfg/issues/10).

But we still want to use base16 themes, since is a very cool architecture for building themes.
To solve the readability issue, we have to use [Set-PSReadlineOption]
to remapping the command line tokens colors to match base16 theme. Below are two screenshots
show the difference after remapping command line tokens colors (see those two commands).

|----------------------|-----------------------|
| ![without-token-color-mapping.png](docs/without-token-color-mapping.png) | ![with-token-color-mapping.png](docs/with-token-color-mapping.png) |

I wrote a powershell script to do this job, you can take a look at [`command-line-token-color-mapping.ps1`](scripts/command-line-token-color-mapping.ps1) in the scripts directory for details.

**P.S.**: the script has been [integrated](https://github.com/lukesampson/concfg/pull/46) into [concfg](https://github.com/lukesampson/concfg), you could use `concfg tokencolor` command to set up the command line token colors.

**NOTE**: If you removed base16 themes from your Windows Console, you should also change the command line tokens colors back. Otherwise it may causes a bad look for your console.
