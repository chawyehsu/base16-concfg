base16-concfg
=============

The real Chris Kempson's [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16)
for [concfg](https://github.com/lukesampson/concfg),
which is utility to import and export Windows console settings bundled with
[Scoop](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop),
a command-line installer for Windows created by Luke Sampson.

**NOTE:** All presets in this repository are generated by a base16-builder,
I use [base16-builder-typescript].

About the Color Mapping
-----------------------

Windows Console (conhost.exe/cmd.exe/Powershell) only use 16 colors palette,
therefore [base16](http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/),
which is based on sixteen colours, would be the best themes solution.

But there are color mapping difference between Windows Console and other terminals or applications.
The colors of Windows Console doesn't map the [ANSI escape color] [^1].
We should treat those most `dark_` colors as major (normal) colors and 
other as minor (bright) colors.
